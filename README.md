Title: IoT-Based IV Bag Monitoring System
Presented at: International Conference on Advancement in Science, Engineering & Technology 2025

Our IoT-Based IV Bag Monitoring System offers a smart solution to prevent risks associated with unnoticed empty IV fluid bags in hospitals. Traditional manual monitoring is time-consuming and prone to human error, which may lead to critical delays or air embolisms.

The proposed system uses a load cell connected to an HX711 amplifier to measure the IV bag‚Äôs weight in real time. An ESP8266 Wi-Fi module collects this data and sends it to a cloud platform (such as Blynk) while simultaneously triggering a local alert through a buzzer and LED indicators whenever the fluid level drops below a defined threshold. This dual-mode alert mechanism ensures hospital staff are notified instantly, whether they are near the patient or monitoring remotely.

The project supports real-time tracking of IV fluid consumption, enabling timely refills and improved patient safety. It is built using low-cost, readily available components, making it scalable and accessible for widespread hospital adoption. Moreover, it can be integrated with broader hospital management systems for future automation needs.

Key Highlights:

‚úÖ Real-time IV weight monitoring

‚úÖ Cloud-based notification and alerts

‚úÖ Affordable and scalable architecture

‚úÖ Supports integration with hospital systems

‚úÖ Reduces manual workload for healthcare workers

This innovative system can also be extended with machine learning or predictive analytics to estimate IV consumption trends and automate future refill schedules.

Applications:

Hospital and clinical patient care

Elderly home-care IV monitoring

Remote healthcare services

Future Scope:
Further development can focus on predictive alerts, automatic shut-off mechanisms, and interoperability with hospital inventory systems to create a more advanced, fully automated patient IV management solution.
