Title: IoT-Based IV Bag Monitoring System
Presented at: International Conference on Advancement in Science, Engineering & Technology 2025

Our IoT-based IV Bag Monitoring System enhances patient safety by automating IV fluid monitoring. Using a load cell with HX711 and an ESP8266 module, the system measures IV bag weight in real time and alerts medical staff through a buzzer and LED locally, while also sending notifications to a cloud platform like Blynk. This prevents risks from unnoticed empty IV bags, reduces manual checks, and saves time for hospital staff.

Key highlights include affordable components, easy scalability, and real-time cloud tracking. The solution supports integration with hospital systems and could evolve to include predictive analytics for advanced healthcare automation.

Applications: Hospitals, clinics, elderly home care, and remote patient monitoring.

Future Scope: Integration with hospital management systems, predictive algorithms for fluid estimation, and automated IV shut-off mechanisms.
